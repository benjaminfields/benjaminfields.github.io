Hi, just a quick fun bio about myself! I am from the southern United States, and am proudly Cameroonian. I like to travel, I have been to almost 20 countries, and I am a HUGE foodie (I love cooking, eating, tasting, and everything in between)!

I have a brother named Patrick who plays football.

I enjoy beaches, looking over the top of cities, and having long conversations!
