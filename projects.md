Project 1 Description

There were three parts!

Part one wants us to create a repo, make a new folder and text file containing all of the commands, and pushing + committing it to GitHub.

Part two wants us to work in a group to create a repo, a few files, and edit the name of the group members file as well as make a text file with our code. Afterwards, we push and commit this to GitHub, but assign another member the pull request.

Part 3 is just creating a new repo, creating an about me page and this file where we describe the project, then push and commit then to GitHub.
